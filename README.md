# Stock Market Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting Tesla's stock price movements using machine learning. By analyzing historical stock data, we employ various models to classify whether the stock price will increase or decrease the next day.

## 📊 Dataset
- The dataset contains Tesla stock price data with features:
  - **Open**
  - **High**
  - **Low**
  - **Volume**
  - **Close (Target Variable)**

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **NumPy & Pandas** – Data handling & processing
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning models
- **XGBoost** – Advanced gradient boosting model

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Stock-Market-Prediction.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Folder:**
   ```sh
   cd Stock-Market-Prediction
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python Script.**

## 📈 Model Performance & Insights
- **Feature Importance:** Open, High, Low, and Volume impact price movement.
- **Best Performing Model:** XGBoost achieved the highest accuracy compared to Logistic Regression and SVM.
- **Stock Price Volatility:** The model performs well but is affected by unpredictable market conditions.

## 🔮 Future Work
- Include additional financial indicators and technical analysis.
- Integrate real-time stock market data.
- Experiment with deep learning models for better prediction accuracy.
- Incorporate sentiment analysis using financial news.
